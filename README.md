# Plant-disease-detection-ensemble_voting

This project proposes a **deep learning-based framework for plant disease detection**, utilizing four pre-trained models: **Inception, ResNet,** and **VGGNet**. The framework aims to aid in **early disease intervention** and **reduce agricultural losses** by identifying plant diseases efficiently.

## Dataset
The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset consisting of **38 distinct classes of plant diseases**, providing extensive coverage for accurate classification.

## Methodology
By employing **transfer learning**, the system achieved:
- **Accuracy:** 96.98%
- **Efficiency:** Reduced training time while improving precision.

Each model played a significant role in enhancing the frameworkâ€™s scalability and accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of using pre-trained architectures for large-scale image classification tasks.

## Key Features
- **Scalable Solution:** Designed for broad applications across different plant species and diseases.
- **Efficient Training:** Leveraging transfer learning minimizes computational resources.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieved a performance metric of **96.98%**.

## Future Scope
The next step is to optimize the framework for **mobile device deployment**, enabling:
- **Real-time disease detection** in practical farm settings.
- Accessibility for farmers worldwide to identify diseases on-site effectively.
